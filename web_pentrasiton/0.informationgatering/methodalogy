first use sublist3r and find subdomin in that site and or you can use crt.sh website to find subdomin you have to extract that using curl 
sublist3r -v  -d mazzady.com
so you have to find which domin is active and which is down
for that use httproc.py
than use dirb 
dirb https://www.mazzady.com/

eg: curl -k -i 'https://paytm.com/?q=%25paytm.com/' | http2text > domin.txt
after that in that file you have to extract only subdomin
eg: cat domin.txt | grep paytm.com | cut or use awk -F '{print $5}' | sort -u
cat httprocout.txt | awk '/https/ {print}' to print only http urls
after that see what website is up 
eg: you use my tool called httpscorn and ok responces code 
or you can use for loop like this for i in $(cat domain.txt) ; do curl -s -o /dev/null -I -w "%{http_code}" https://$site --max_time 5; 
printf " -$site \n" & done > alive.txt

than you will get which is 200 ok code or not 
after that you can use eyewitness to take screenshot 

eyewitness  -f/root/domin.txt -d --all-protocal
after that find any api.paytm.com and get the ip address

use nmap -sC -sV -oA -T4 nmap 127.0.0.1 
use dirb https://www.mazzady.com -r -o tmp.dir

use searchsploit *tornet_sploit*
searchsploit -x rmote
intersept the login detail and copy the raw data from burp and save it as file and run for sqlmap 
like sqlmap -r login.req --level 5 --risk 3
