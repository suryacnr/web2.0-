DNS enumerations:
first try to find the ip adderss of website using host
host humo.be 
(or)
host -t ns humo.be ==>ns stands for name server
Even you can do rverse lookup 
EG:
root@kali:~# host humo.be
humo.be has address 23.59.175.80
humo.be has address 23.59.175.73
humo.be has IPv6 address 2600:1417:75::17d4:fd51
humo.be has IPv6 address 2600:1417:75::17d4:fd23
humo.be mail is handled by 10 aspmx2.googlemail.com.
root@kali:~# host 23.59.175.80
80.175.59.23.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer a23-59-175-80.deploy.static.akamaitechnologies.com.

Than you can use nslookup humo.be
you can also use nslookup and hit enter
nslookup 
> set type=ns
>humo.be

nslookup
> SERVER 23.59.175.73
Default server: 23.59.175.73
Address: 23.59.175.73#53
> 127.0.0.1

next you should go for dig deper using the tool called dig
dig humo.be
and dig humo.be -t mx ==> for mail
dig humo.be -t ns ===> name server
dig humo.be AAAA ==>for ipv6
dig humo.be CNMAE ===> if this domin is chained to anthore domain
dig humo.be -t ns +short ==> it strips and gives only important info 


You can make zone transfere :
dig axfr humo.be @ eru.akro.be (name server of humo.be)
may be dns server  is secured for zone transfer in this case use udp or bruteforce 
next you should go for brute force for that you should have good word list use secword list 
you can use nmap $nmap -p 53 --script dns-brute humo.be
next use dnsmap $dnsmap humo.be -w /user/share/Seclist/Discovery/dns
fierce -dns humo.be -w /user/share/etc....

And than scan the ip address with nmap $nmap -sC -sV -p53 192.168.x.0/24
Now you can find what the ip address are up and down using this commend
next agin scan $nmap -sC -sV  -n -Pn 23.59.175.73
if dns is runing in this port use nsloopup
