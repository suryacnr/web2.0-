1.scope domine
2.acquistions
3.ASN enumeration
4.revers whois
5.subdomin enumeration
6.port analysis

	scope domine
1.find root /seed
	to find what all the domine are in scope in bug bounty
	this is simple and first step
	
	
2.acquistions
	we need to gether seed /root .acquistions are new way to expand our avilable asserts if they are in scope .we can investigate company acqusitions on sits like https://crunchbase.com,
	wikipedia, google you can search google like acquisitions made by mazzady
	
3.ASN enumeration
	asn is autonomous system number asn is allocated to each as for use in bgp routing
	 ASN uniquely identifies each network on the Internet.
	 you can find asn in the site like https://bgp.he.net you can also use cmd line asn enumeration 
	 using metabigor and asn lookup by yassine 
	 To find more seed domins we need to scan whole asn with port scaner and return any root domins we see in ssl certificates ,etc
	 $amass intel -asn 4657
	
4.reverse whois
	"""First allways try going to terminal root@kali:~# whois mazzady.com"""
	Than Do DNS enumeration 
	test for week ciphers:
	nmap -p 443 --script=ssl-enum-ciphers humo.be


	
	every website as register info about the page two key picess of data we can use are organisation name and email in whoixy lookup
	you can access this by whoxy.com
	you can also automate this throw domlink.py -d mazzady.com -o mazzady_output.txt
	$python3 domLink.py  -A 57f575fad6f96ab6w315cbaecae138247 -o mazzady.txt mazzady.com
	a.) ad/anlaytics relationships
		you can also gleen related domins and subdomin by looking at the target ad/anlaytics relationships coder many websites uses the same coder across the domin. we can look at the relationship with buildwith.com
	b.)google dorks
		site:twitch.tv -www.twitch.tv -dev.twitch.tv until you find all subdomain
		site:yeswehack.com inurl:& -category -both -iteam
		site:yeswehack.com ext:php (jsp,asp,aspx,xml,txt)
		site:yeswehack.com inurl:admin(login, register, lougout, unscribe, redirect, redirecturl)the possibilite are endles 

	c.) shadon
		https://www.shodan.io/search?query=mazzady.com
	
	d.) github
			"company" password , admin ,if you can find any information in code digdeper than search for the person who as return the code..... 
			"company"state(staging, stg, dev, prod, qa, swagger) 
			"company"apikey(apiSecret, x-api-keys, apidocs, /api/ , /internal/api/)
			"company" look for specific fetures /services such as login signup register admin administrator appspot (stating service)? firebase, testuser, password testing  
	
5.subdomin enumeration
	Are divided into three 
	a.) linked and js Discovery 
	b.) subdomin scraping 
	c.) subdomin bruteforce
	
	1. linked and js discovery
	another way to examine all the link in main target using burpsuite pro
	we can visit a seed/root and reqursively spider all the links and their link and so on until we have found all sites could be in scoup 
	you can also use gospider and hakrawler in cmd

	To find more endpoints 
	To find more urls you can use gau , waybackurl , paramspider
	qreplace to replace in the payload
	after finising gf for pattern matching from the url but you maybe limited so always use grep "="
	eg: $ cat wayburl.txt | grep "="|egrep -iv ".(jpg|png|css|gif|tif|woff|ico|pdf|svg|txt|js)"
	combaine several files into one file eg: cat file1 file2 file3 >allfiles
	
	2.subdomain enumeration with subdoaminizer
	  subscraper
	  find subdomain referenced in js file 
	  find cloud services references in js file 
	  use the shannon entropy formula to find potentialy sensitive file in js
	  $ python3 SubDomainizer.py  -u https://yeswehack.com
	
	3.subdomain scraping sources 
	subfinder -d yeswehack.com -v
	image as been attached 
	amass and subfinder and git-subdomain.py for subdomain scraping	
	amass -d twitch.tv
	subdomain with cloud ranges
	you can use sslscrape or you can creat by our own by Daehee park outliness it here.

	4.subdoamin brutforcing amass
	you can find some other domain is in humo.be
	$amass intel -org "hum.be"
	$amass intel -asn 66988 -whois
	you can also use passive mode 
	$amass enum -passive -d humo.be
	amass offer by enum tool using the brute switch
	~$ amass enum  -brute -d twitch.tv -src
	$ amass emun -src -ipv4 -d humo.be
	its build in list but can specify you own list
	you can also specipy any number of resolves 
	~$ amass enum -brute -d twitch.tv  -rf  resolves.txt  -w bruteforces.list
	after enumerating you can so visualization 
	$amass viz -dir ~/amass -d3 -o ./
	$firefox output.html
	you can use amass track for track the previuse one and the new one to track any new subdomain are added
	$amass  track -d humo.be -history
	you can use db for data base list
	$amass db -list
	$amass  db -enum 1 -show

	same thing can be done in shuffledns
	~$ shuffledns -d hackerone.com -w worldlist.txt  -r resolvers-excellent.txt
	this all things become super cool when you use good word list 
	go see for what where when who worldlist by tomnom

	5.alteration scanning altdms
	now amass as logic to check for these permition amass includes in defult pip install -r requirements.txt

other 
	after findings this go for port scan using mass can 
	most hacker could use nmap  here but masscan is more faster for general finding open port tcp 
	simple syntax  for scanning for list of ips:
	$host twitch.tv
	$masscan -p1-65535-iL 127.0.0.1 --max-rate1800 -oG $outputfile 

	port analysisa(dnmasscan)
	one limitation of masscan is that it only scan ip address. Y
	dnmasscan example.txt dns.log-p80,443,8080 -oG masscan.log

	service scanning (brutespry)
	when we get service port  information we can feed it to nmap to get oG output file 
	we can scan remote administration protocalsfor defult passwords with tools called brutespry

	github dorking
	many orgenaization grow in there engineer tearms soner or later new devloper
	or they are stap will leap sources code online throw public github.com
	"github search" 
	github sensitive data exposure @the3g3ntelmans.

	screenshot (eyewitness,aquatone, httpscreenshot)
	you can do this step  manualy or by taking 10 targets at the time or you can  take screenshot 

subdomain takeover(can i take over xyz)
	if subdomain pointing to github.com and the user decided to delet the page now the the attacker can creat the page and creat and  add the cname containing files 
	A Great resouces for subdomain takeover is ED 	overlows repo can i take over xyz
	SUBOVER & NUCLEI
Automation ++ 
	interlace
 
Framework 
S-tires automation writing their own moduel has GUI run interativily mange data via bd scale across multiple boxes.Send alert to users. uses novel techniques and iterates quicly.ML+AI
