server does check the user genarated the request 
if it is get or  post just copy the form from the web 
save the form with .html  and the action field must be full url. if its only the file it doesnt now where the file is locted ,

tip 1
you can bypass the csrf token by simply removing the token 
tip 2 
try to convert the post to get and remove the csrf token if it still work there sever side csrf 
POST /change_passwordPOST body:new_password=qwerty

Can be rewritten as:

GET /change_password?new_password=qwerty
tip 3:
some website check only for valid token but not whoes the token belongs to 
so try to check like this 
POST /change_passwordPOST body:new_password=qwerty &csrf_tok=871caef0757a4ac9691aceb9aad8b65b

Send this:

POST /change_password
POST body:new_password=qwerty &csrf_tok=YOUR_TOKEN
tip 4:
