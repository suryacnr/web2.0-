For websites that adopt a password-based login process, users either register for an account themselves or they are assigned an account by an 
administrator.
Consequently, the security of the website would be compromised if an attacker is able to either obtain or guess the login credentials of another user
1.you should always try to brute forces the login page using hydra or burp suite 
2.flowed brute forces production 
		if you brute forces they secur by two ways 
 blocking your ip addres 
 temprawry blocking your account
 this may be secure but not highsecure its in vulnerable 
 1.ip blocking :
 	this is bypassed by. if they block the ip addreas while your bruet forcsing others acc after few or 5 attempts for incorrect password.
 	you just enter your username and password than try for brute forces use your user name and password for every 5 attempnst to prevernt account blocking
 2. account locking 
 
 1.password guessing
 	go to intruder and simply brute fources username only with list of user name than enable new column responces timing you notice you will get high resoponce and low responce timing becouse of database if the user exists the responces timing will be higher and if the user doesnt exit the responce timing will be less 
 	if feal something goes wrong on the responces timing you can right click an request item again
