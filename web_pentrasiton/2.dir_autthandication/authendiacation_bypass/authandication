authentication means entring into confrances without the  pass is called broken authentication
autherization means each users as seprate privilages like principle and staff and children

1.what is authentication 
there are three factors of authentication :
some you now like password or security questions 
some you have like physical objects like mobile number or security question
something  you are do, for eg biomatric are patern begavior

2.the differ between autentication are authrosization 
Authentication is the process of verifying that a user really is who they claim to be, eg: really to check who the owner is
whereas authorization involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something. eg: like delet account or view information of others

3.how do vulnerability arise?
 Broadly speaking, most vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms arise in one of two ways:

 The authentication mechanisms are weak because they fail to adequately protect against brute-force attacks.
 Logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation allow the authentication mechanisms to be bypassed entirely by an attacker. 
 This is sometimes referred to as "broken authentication"

4.mainly we are going to look into three types are:
   Vulnerabilities in password-based login
   Vulnerabilities in multi-factor authentication
   Vulnerabilities in other authentication mechanisms
