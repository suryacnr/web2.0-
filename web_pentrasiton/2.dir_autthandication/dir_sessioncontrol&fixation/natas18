first try to fuzz the phpseesion id or session token eg: phpsession_id = 545
for next level go for sequancer and then it will catch phpsessionid automatically than give start live capture it will analyzie 1000 of phpsessionid
than try to decode using cyberchef first use base64 if it is not proper string than try for hex than you will get a proper decoded value eg: 545admin
now fuzz the value use 1 to 1000 and suffex the admin than grep the comment in webpage as your logged in  and than add ascii hex 
after that if you fuzz you will get admincookie value
level 20 
first try to find which charcter are filter and which are not 
in burp use hex decimal chaecter 00 to FF max char=2 than add prefix % than use url decode u can try  with or without url decode  last you should use
grep comment to include in the webpage that gives the mess
if you did get any thing you can use fuzz db  which includes all type of attack 
first step or requlare methodalogy is:
try to fuzz the the get paramter like GET /?$admin$=$admin$/HTTPS/ ==> use gess get parameter in burp  to use this 
level 21 
befor trying this you form value should change or replact in the cookie vlaue after that 
you can try to add extra value in the login page or some other form page 
eg: username = surya& password = surya &test =123
