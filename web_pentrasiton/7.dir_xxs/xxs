There are mainly three types of xss :
1.replacted xss
2.stored xss
3.DOMbased xss
three things are used to not to inject xss are:
encoding 
< == this will be encoded in &lt
filters
<script> == script> this will elmnate the < sym
validation
<script> ==  this will remove the <script>
sanitizastion 
combination all 
if they filter you  on client side u can be easly bypass that filter
by using hello"onmouseiver="alert('xss');
or <svg/onload=alert(1+2)>
if they filter " or ' you can use
string(/omouseover=/alrt("xss");
or string.formcharcode(72.09.97.24)
or you can use atob()== base64 into stringeg:atob("BAXZw") and btoa()==into base64 eg:btoa("hello") for base64 encoding and decoding
than you can use ` instad of "

1.REPLACTED XSS:
    this is simple first should enter the worlds in parameters if it is replacted there is replacted xss this is only one client side 

2.STORED XSS:
		this is bit diffiult as like replacted you should enter the words.if it is stored in database like comment session if you can 
trigger xss than it is stored based xss 

 
		
3.DOMBASED XSS:






the filters can be bypassed using | and & using this 
eg : <script>alert('xss')</script> in this case if they can use filter to remove you can use | like this <script>|<script>alert('xss')</script>
or you can use &symbile 
eg2:
 you can use \ escape character <iframe src = "javascript:alert('xss')"> you can use the filters "<iframe src = \"javascript:alert('xss')\">


 look for "var" in source code and search for it than try to triger what is going on  than try to change user agenta 
try to uncomment the things in source code 
		
https://jsfiddle.net/
if they dont allow any special charater or url encoding just make iframe option 
<iframe src ="https://xyz.com/id?id=javascript:name" name ="<svg/onload=alert(0)> ">
</iframe>
what is htmlentity

Goal is to determine what is being filtered
1.are the basic allwoed "'<> allowed? what if you try them  by themself , diff begivour?
2.ls "on[]=" filterd or is it just the commen 'onerror','onmouseover','onclick' etc ? what about onxxx
3. how do they handle unicode, double encoding, unusual encoding?

Tips and Tricks:
This is for block list waf:
inspect element and view source are different and view source & burp responces are same 
search for replaction than try htmlthan do for double encoding 
allways try to double encode eg:%2525 than do html injection like <h1>, <b>, <s>
1. if they block you for special characters like secipt than try for img, a , svg , than try for onload if they block you use onx ,onxxxx becouse  some waf will block you when you use onerror , onmouseover="" in these case if they forget to block  eg: new event handlers etc than you can bypass if you dont know new handles than try for google documentation mozila 

white list fire wall
try for unicode encoding for backend waf .best fit maping 
try for sending emoji see what happens coz backend sufers
use comments first<!
if application uses python you can use (,) comma to sperat  that why  is this happing coz of paraser how it works
if there is any hidden parameter take that search in url parameter some times work as replected
after that go to knoxss and xsshunter in website 
you can practise in they own website  eg: cloudfare.com/<xss onfocus=alert('xss')>
