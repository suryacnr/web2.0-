first see for what type of strings in cookkie ty basically it may be hex or base64 or md5hash
A-Z =26
0-9 =10
+ / = 2
total=64
and in the end there will be == its sure its base64
   
use cyber chef to bake the string to from hex means hex to binary 
secound use the reves string
eg ==QWdeA to AedWQ==
third use from base64


xor for natas11
 take the cookie and see whether what type of encoding is been used in natas they have been used urldecode with base64 
 and you will get junk file 
 

xor as been using decription in three ways 
key = adsf
cipher = UK"..H+..O%...pS.Wh]UZ-..T%.U.hR.^,..^h
clear text = 
in xor if you have any two  you will get 1 
eg: you have cipher and you may get clear text you will not get key value 
than you have to jshon encode with clear tet 
eg : array( "showpassword"=>"no", "bgcolor"=>"#ffffff"); like this echo jashonencode(array( "showpassword"=>"no", "bgcolor"=>"#ffffff"))
than in cyber chef use xor and give the cipher value and the key value of clear text of jashonencoded
than you will get the repited words take only once repted key

than do base64 you will get the answer
