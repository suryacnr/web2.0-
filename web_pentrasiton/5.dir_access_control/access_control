acess control 
vertical access control means the adminstrator can access and delet or modify the user account but not reqular users cant perporm this accstion

horizontal access control means those who have permistion to access the user account or only allowed eg: bank allowes the user to view transaction 
or deposite the money only to there own acccount not to athers account

context access control means it does not allowes the user to modefy content and functonlaity of the web page like parameter tamering eg:
website might prevent user from modefying the content from the shoppig card after they made payment

Go to storage in dev tools in that go to sessionid in that try to change key value tat may be vulnerable to access control 
in secound chalange if you cant change the key vakue than  in burp change the product id and add the bsket value to 2 eg ;"basketid" = "2"
you can change the author name to comment in comment section and change the name
to submit the feedback by other user you should go to dev and delete the contant of userid = hidden and remove them and you can see the userid 
field  eg: userid = 19 change it to = 2

1.vertical privilege escalation:
  if a non administrator user account can gain acces to admin page wher they can delet user account then it is vertical privalege
 For example, a website might host sensitive functionality at the following URL:

https://insecure-website.com/admin ==> if you did get the admin page you can use word list bruteforces
or even you can get it from robots.txt file 
if the adminstrator page is not gessable and if url is disclosed in javascript it can be seen by all users

parameter access control :
when url is get based in login or paramter is visible like this https://insecure-website.com/login/home.jsp?admin=true than user can easly modefy 
?admin=true to ?admin=false or role=1 to role =2

Broken access control resulting from platform misconfiguration:
some application may use access control at platform layer to specify certain rules like deany DENY: POST, /admin/deleteUser, managers
this will deny  the post request in /admin/deletuser
some website framework use non standerd http-headers than can be used to overwrite the url in orginal request eg: X-Original-URL and X-Rewrite-URL.
if the website is very carefull in frond end to restrict  access control but it allowes request header to  rewrite than it can be essaly bypassed

if the user allows the restricted page to modefy by some other methods like get put it is also bypassed

k
2.horizontal privilage escalation :
	if the user is able to gain access  of another user instant of its own resources or type eg:the employer should ba able to use its own 
account but if he access other user payment then it is horizontal privilage escalation
horizontal privilage is also like vertical privilage
https://insecure-website.com/myaccount?id=123  if the user modefy the id params he can gain access of another user
in some web site its not possiable to gess instant of number 1,2,3,etc it may be random string However,
 the GUIDs (Universally unique identifier)belonging to other users might be disclosed elsewhere in the application where users are referenced 
like user message and review . some time the software detects the user and redirect to login page mith is it still contain some sentive data

3.horizontal and vertical privilage esualtion
		this is done by only if the user can gain access of administrator by other user and he can delet or modefy 

4.IDOR(inseure direct object referances):
		if you want to view to some file or document file  you want the referances of the page you can edit the document file and if you can 
view index.php file or some other file than it is idor execution


5.Access control vulnerabilities in multi-step processes
