what is object referances ?
key 1 fetches the database record of user 1
key 2 fetches the database record of user 2
key 3 fetches the database record for admin

1.horizontol privilage esculation:
what if the   user1 has got access to key2 and is able retrive user2 data from the database  
if both user belongs to same catergiry its horizontal privilage 
	we should find how the website is using user information like user_id=6 you should find this first

2. vertical privilage esculation 
what if the user1 has got access to key2 is able to retirive admin data from the database


insecure direct object referance 
look for 
multi tanant system  ==> viewing other business information  
multi user system ==> viewing other user information
multi level system

how to look for idors

find the js function to call different kind of functionality
replace the sequential id in parameter 
newer do these with prd with an unkown id 
always make 2 account
 
Types of idors 
1. typical idor ==> if you are loged in you cannot look for other user information
2. unauthendicated  idor ==> if you are not loged in you cannot view any information of athers
3. permission idors ==>  admin can acess all user but normal user cannot 



idor can occure if attacker can assces or modefy some referance of some object such as files record database account 
where things go more difficult if the site try to observe and randomize identifier the object referance
such universal unique identifiers (UUIDs) In this case, the ID might be a 36 character alpha numeric string which is impossible to guess
in this case one way is create two user account switch between those users so if your trying to access user id uuid create the profile with user A and the user B  try to access that profile with uuid since you now that
if your try to access uniqe id like invoice id trips etc all identifyed by uuid simlare to the example above 
the next step is to find where the uuid is leaked for example the tearm based sites can you invite uers B to your tearm if so server responces with uuid  before even they accepts the invitation .thats the one way the site leaks uuid 
In other situations, check the page source when visiting a profile. Sometimes sites will include a JSON blob for the user which also includes all of the records created by them thereby leaking sensitive UUIDs 

example 1:
Before the hack, if you logged into Binary.com/cashier and inspected the page HTML, youâ€™d notice an <iframe> tag which included a PIN parameter. That parameter was actually your account ID.
now if you edit and insert another pin now site will perform new account with validathing password or other credntial.
if your looking for broken authentication lookout for where credintial are being passed to site this was cought by view sources this can be cought by burp suite 
if you find some credintial being passed look for where they dont not look encrypted and try to play with it 
 
 example 2:


where is the problem 
the core problem is lack of autherization check before loading the date
developer missconception
url is being past to the sever throw post or hidden form field that may not get tampred
