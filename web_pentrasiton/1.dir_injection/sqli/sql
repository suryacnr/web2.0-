 sql inject is used to attack the database of the server by injcting simple ($select title, text from news where id=10 or 1=1 )
admin and 1=1 , admin or 1=1 using this and or operater and commends are used to comment out after the payloads # . --+, -- 

sql inject attack can be divided into three parts 
1.inband ==> is extracted using the same channel the most straight forword attack 

2.outband ==> is  extracted using the diffrent channel 

3.blind ==> ther is no transfer of data the tester able to reconstract the data  by sending particular requset and obesrving th data in dbserver 

the sql query is injected correctly if it gives error about the query it is esay for an attacker to correct the synatans if the application hidded
the information than the attacker must be able to reverces enginer

The 5 commen technique to exploit the sql injection 
1.union operation 

2. boolean 

3.error based 

4.out band 

5.time dely  

Detection Techniques:
 first we want to find where the application is talking to Db server like
authendication form 
search enginne 
e-commerces website
the first simple step is add " or ' or ; this is used as sql string terminator if web doesnt use fillter it gives query error.secound is to end the
statment if the web doesnot filter anything it gives query error. the end statment are ( -- or /**/ or # etc) and also sql stament like AND OR can 
used to modefy the query 
2.the simple step but very effective technique to simple type '28274782'if you get error message like insert string but excpected  int
some times information may be hidden in sources code like in html cmmend and javascript code you may not be to luck to get so much information 
you will be simple get 504 error or 404 so you should use blind sql attack
it is very import to test each field separately in brutforce only one variable should vary while other should be constant
