it very easy find for parmaeter and search for test if it reflect than try for commend injection 
eg: test ; ls or test | ls 
this are the two ways for commend injection
or use sub commend aa $(aa) or a $(ls) they did likes this grep - i 
they allword us to view the /etc/ natas folder 
so just simple did like this if a contain in the directory we are giving 
a /etc/natas_webpass/natas11

next try to find what characters are allowed and which are not allowed for that simple intercept proxy and
creat the payload like 00 to ff using % in frent of that eg: %0A and also use url decode  this url decode must be (on and off) and then add filter
iteam as an illegal character or login failed  in burp 
this is will work only if the programer as blacklisted the character instant use white list

the third way is to use sub shell eg: echo test you can sub shell this by using echo te$(hello)st this will give tehellost as output
there is actuall try boolean statment like $(grep 2 /etc/natas_webpass/natas17)sclap if 2 exits in natas folder it will not return any thing if 2
doesnt exits it will return sclap
so the password contain 32 char you cant brute force becouse it jumbled character 
 so we can use regeas $(grep -E ^a.*$ /etc/natas_webpass/natas17)sclap ==> -E turn into regas  ^a is starting word .* is next word $ untill end of
statment in grep comment
finally the password contains 32char ans  you should brute force and find the word which starts will first letter . you cant use brute force for 32cha
so we have created python coding for that 


yous grep -R . will return all files for full output of that page
or you can use while read line ; do
