dom based oopen redirection arrises when the script writes attacker control the data into sink that trigger cross domin navigation
let url=/https?:\/\/.+/.exec(location.hash)
    if(url) {
        location = url[0];
    } 
 if this type of coding is used its vulnerable for redirection coz this script is handle in unsafe way

 Dom based cookie manuplation vulner:


 many sink are largely harmless on ther own but dom based cookie manuplation attack demonstrate how low security can be used as exploit chain for high security attack for eg: if java script document.cookie is used withiut santising first an attacker can manuplate the value of single cookie to arbritary value

 document.cookie = 'cookieName='+location.hash.slice(1);
