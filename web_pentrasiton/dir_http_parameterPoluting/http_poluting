HTTP Parameter Pollution, or HPP, occurs when a website accepts input from a user and
uses it to make an HTTP request to another system without validating that user’s input.
amount=1000&fromAccount=12345&toAccount=99999
A site vulnerable to an HPP attack would forward the request to the other back end
system looking like:
toAccount=9876&amount=1000&fromAccount=12345&toAccount=99999
HTTP Parameter Pollution
18
<? $val=htmlspecialchars($_GET['par'],ENT_QUOTES); ?>
<a href="/page.php?action=view&par='.<?=$val?>.'">View Me!</a>
This takes a value for par from the URL, makes sure it’s safe and creates a link out of it.
Now, if an attacker submitted:
http://host/page.php?par=123%26action=edit
the resulting link would look like:
<a href="/page.php?action=view&par=123&amp;action=edit">View Me!</a>
PHP/Apache uses the last occurrence, 
Apache Tomcat uses the first occurrence,
ASP/IIS uses all occurrences, etc.
